PDF to Speech Converter

Overview

This project converts text from a PDF file into speech using pyttsx3, allowing users to listen to their documents instead of reading them. The script extracts text from each page of the selected PDF and reads it aloud.

Features

Dependencies

pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech Engine)

How It Works
